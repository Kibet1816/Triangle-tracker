## Project description
This is an application that allows a user to key in triangle dimensions and tells the user what kind of triangle is formed.It uses the following logic:

- Equilateral triangle;if all sides posses an equal value,
- Isosceles triangle;if only two sides have equal values,
- Scalene triangle ; if neither of the three sides have the same value,
- No triangle at all;if the sum of any of the two sides is less than or equal to the final value.
 
## Setup instructions
- A web browser
- Simply type the dimensions of your triangle in the input fields
- Click on the 'submit' button to view results
- Reload the webpage before trying another set of values

## BDD
The application is required to do the following:
- Accept user input
- Load results after the submit button is clicked
- The results should include the type of triangle formed and a picture of the triangle

## Technologies used
The following languages have been used to write the application:
- HTML,
- JavaScript,
- CSS, and
- Markdown.
